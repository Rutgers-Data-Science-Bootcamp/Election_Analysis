# Election-Analysis
Using Python to analysis Colorado election outcome for three candidates from three counties.  

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Election employee has gave me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.
1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote. 

## Resources 
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.10, Visual Studio Code, 

## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
- The candidates were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham
    - Diana DeGette
    - Raymon Anthony Doane
- the Candidate results were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 of votes.
    - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 of votes.
    - Raymon Anthony Doane 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 of votes.
- The winner of the election was:
    - Candidate Diana DeGette, who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes. 

## Challenge Overview
- The main challenge was for me, while using python code to get required information from the election result stored in csv file to learn and BECOME confortable with coding with python. 

# Challenge Summary
Election result analysis is quite straight forward, can be analysed in excel quickly, however, by using python to code will be very useful to analysis same type of data again and again with just one click to run the analysis.
